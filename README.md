# Ng2 WebWorker Scrolling Table Demo
This is a demo of using custom elements with WebWorkers in Angular 2.

# Run Demo
First clone the repo and then run `npm run tsc`. This will compile the TypeScript files, and watch for changes.
In a seperate terminal window run `npm start`. This will start up a local webserver and open your browser to the demo page.
